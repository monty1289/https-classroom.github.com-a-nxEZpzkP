    <p>The workshops are at our rural property "The Park" situated five kilometers east of Otane in Central Hawkes Bay which
      is on the east coast of the North Island, New Zealand. We were the overall winners of the Hawkes Bay Business of the year 
      awards in 2001 and were awarded the Hawkes Bay Chamber of Commerce Exporter of the year award in 2010. Having spent several 
      years as semi-professional polo player on the international circuit, I'm well aware of the demands of discerning polo players. 
      I've spent more time and effort than anyone else on Earth developing the composite polo mallet.</p>
      <p>We're also world leaders in the development of the croquet mallet. We source the best possible materials from around the world 
        and craft them into high performance sports goods. We take as much pride in our craftsmanship and product quality as we do in our 
        customer service and overall business excellence. Approximately 87% of our turnover is exported to over 50 different countries. Many 
        of our customers go to the trouble of letting us know how happy they are with our products. Some of these comments may be read at user 
        comments polo or croquet.</p>
